# Source code to _Evaluating Fairness in Machine Learning: Comparative Analysis and Benchmarking of Fairlearn and AIF360_

The implementation and effectiveness of fairness toolkits in machine learning, specifically AIF360 and Fairlearn, 
significantly differ in terms of ease of integration, data handling capabilities, metric variety, and algorithmic performance.
These differences can substantially impact their adoption and effectiveness in various socio-
economic and organizational contexts, influencing the overall fairness of machine learning
systems in real-world applications. This work aims to evaluate the differences between those
most popular fairness toolkits.
